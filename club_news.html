                <p class="mainheader">Director of Coaching Karen Willoughby to coach Singapore youth as part of a US. Government Exchange Program</p>
                <p>Karen Willoughby will travel to Singapore as part of The International Center's Sports Corps Division's Singapore America Soccer Exchange.   This exchange program, in cooperation with the Football Association of Singapore and the United States Embassy in Singapore is made possible by a grant from the SportsUnited Division of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State. The program aims to further improve understanding between the people of Singapore and the United States through sports.   I am very excited to learn from the Singapore coaches as well as working with the Singapore players, Karen commented before her departure".  "It is so important to learn from different coaches".</p>
            	<br />
              <p><strong>Components of the Program</strong></p>
                <br />
              <p>The Singapore America Soccer Exchange program will consist of two main components.  The first component includes five training clinics that will train a total of 500-600 female athletes and athletes with disabilities in the 12-20 year old range and an additional 40-50 coaches.  This first component will be conducted December 3–8 2012.  Karen joins 3 other American Coaches for the Singapore portion.  The second component includes an 8-10 day visit to the United States for a smaller group of Singaporean athletes and coaches in 2013.</p>
            	<br />
                <p><strong>Public-Private Partnerships</strong></p>
                <br />
                <p>The Singapore America Soccer Exchange program will be enhanced by strong participation of the U.S. private sector.  We look forward to working closely with U.S. companies to build better relationships with the people of Singapore.
