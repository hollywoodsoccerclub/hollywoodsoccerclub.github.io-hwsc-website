                <p class="mainheader">Soccer Programs and Camps:</p>
                <p>We have the following programs and camps for our kids, ages 5-14. </p>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Kinder Kick</p>
                <p>HWSC offers a special program for children beginning Kindergarten in the fall. “Kinder Kick” is a weekly group activity filled with fun activities and informal scrimmages.  Parents are encouraged to <a href="registration.html">register</a> as assistant coaches. The cost includes a HWSC t-shirt.</p><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Thursdays in front of Grant HS. 4-5 and 5-6 p.m.</li>
                    <li>We have two sessions to accommodate size and parents schedules.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Recreational</p>
                <p>HWSC registers players between the ages of 6 - 14, or first-eighth grade for recreational soccer.  Recreational soccer players can be new to the sport, or have prior experience.  Teams are created based on interest and availability of volunteer coaches. </p>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Competitive (Classic)</p>
                <p>Hollywood SC is a founding and supporting member of the <a href="http://www.NorthEastUnited.us" target="_blank">Northeast United</a> (NEU) competitive and development programs.  For Hollywood players at the U11-U14 level that are interested in a competitive league, <a href="http://www.NorthEastUnited.us" target="_blank">NEU</a> is a great place to look.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Development Academy</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.northeastunitedsoccer.org/home.php?layout=2763" target="_blank">The NEU Development Academy</a> program is designed to complement a U9-U11 player's participation in recreational soccer by providing once-a-week training sessions with NEU's coaches. The program is for players who want skill training in addition to what they are getting with their recreational team. Our goal is to provide the young player an introduction to a more competitive level of soccer with technical training, tactical basics and game play in a fun environment with other like-minded soccer players.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Soccer Camps</p>
                <p>Hollywood Soccer Club is pleased to partner with The Portland Timbers in bringing summer soccer camps to our neighborhood.  They bring a high degree of professionalism to our community, offering low staff-camper ratios of 12:1 and base groupings on skill level and player age.  Each camp is centered around age-appropriate exercises and activities designed to develop technical excellence and build a love for the game.  The camp program is designed to teach young players life values and life skills that are far reaching beyond the soccer field.  TEAMWORK, RESPECT, EFFORT, ENVIRONMENT and SPORTSMANSHIP are incorporated into the camp curriculum. The camps are currently intended for players age 5-13.  Please visit the <a href="http://www.portlandtimbers.com/youth/portland-timbers-camp-program" target="_blank">Portland Timbers Camp website</a> for details.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Hollywood Soccer Camp may also host other camp opportunities, both during the summer and at other times of the year.  To receive timely notification of these outstanding opportunities, be certain to subscribe to our mailing list via the link at bottom of this page</p>
                <br />
                <p>We also recommend the long-running Concordia Soccer Camps run by Concordia University Soccer Coaching Staff, and staffed by their collegiate team players.  The program is run at nearby Concordia University.  Find out more camp details by following the 'Camps' link from the <a href="http://www.gocugo.com" target="_blank">Concordia website</a>.  Grant HS Men's Coach, Manolis Tjuanakis, runs a back to Fall Season Camp at Fernhill each August that provides a good low coach/camper ratio with some of the top local coaches in NE, with details distributed to the club mailing list.</p>
