               <p class="mainheader">Spring Soccer Season:</p>
                <p>Registration for spring soccer begins in late January. All returning player families will receive email notification that provides detailed instructions on how to register for spring league. As we grow our spring program, the registration process is likely to change along with it. Email notification is the best way for you to receive the most current/accurate information on registration. If you want to be included in our  distribution and are not a current member, notify the club Registrar to be  included.</p>
                <br />
                <p>We need coaches! Time commitment is minimal for spring league, which typically has a game-only schedule. The more volunteers we have, the more playing  opportunities for our kids. Spring registration is open to all <strong>U7-U14</strong> (1st through 8th grade) players. </p>
              <br />
              <p>Due to  popular demand and new for this year, we are including a three week <strong>Kinder Kick</strong> program.&nbsp; Yes! <strong>Kinder Kick in the spring</strong>.&nbsp; We will  host up to 40 players (depending on coach participation), running three weekday session during   the month of May.&nbsp; Spring Kinder Kick is open only to  players that are returning as members of Hollywood   SC from last fall.&nbsp; If space  remains available at start of season, the club may open registration to new  members.&nbsp; Please forward inquiries to the club Registrar.<br />
                <br />
              Fees are typically  lower for spring league than in the fall.&nbsp; For the 2015 Spring season, fees are $45 for U7-U14 and $20 for Kinder Kick.&nbsp; The fees are subject to  change annually without notification. </p>
              <p><br />
                </p>
              <p>Note:  as we grow our spring program, the registration process will likely change  along with it. Hollywood SC may revert to having coaches handle all  player registration in future seasons. Please always check your &lsquo;Inbox&rsquo; and the  club website for details prior to registering.</p>

               <p class="mainheader2">Player Applicant Details:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Per PYSA tradition, games are on Saturdays as well as one weekend with both a Saturday and Sunday game. Also expect one possible travel game (e.g., Beaverton).</li>
                	<li>Per PYSA policy, season will be a game-only schedule with no outdoor practices unless your coach makes alternate arrangements</li>
                	<li>Please note that completion of the on-line application does not guarantee placement. Coach availability and roster size limits may restrict the number of players. You are encouraged to register early. Teams will be filled on a first-come basis for all returning HWSC players before March 1st, at which time it will open to all players on a first-come basis. While we attempt to group players per the fall team arrangement, this may not always be possible.</li>
                	<li>No player will be prevented from participation due to inability to pay. Please contact any Board member with scholarship requests.</li>
                	<li>For players that did not participate with Hollywood SC during the preceding fall season, you will be required to have current PYSA insurance. If you played with another club in PYSA last Fall, you are already covered. If not, you will be required to pay a $19 insurance fee in addition to your regular registration.  If you are coming to us from another PYSA member club, you will be required to email notification forwarded by your previous club Registrar in order to avoid the $19 insurance fee – no exceptions.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p class="mainheader2">Coach Applicant Details:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Coaches must register for spring league even if you registered the previous fall.</li>
                	<li>All coaching staff must pass a background check. If you volunteered as a Coach, Asst Coach, Team Manager last fall, you are covered by our insurance policy and already have a completed background check.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mainheader2">Registration Information:</p>
                <p>Registration for HWSC recreational Fall soccer league begins approximately May 15th of each year and continues through August 31st on a space-available basis.  Applicants are accepted on a first-come basis, regardless of any history with HWSC.  All interested families are encouraged to register early to ensure placement.  Payment is required at time of registration in order to reserve a spot.  Applications with unpaid balances are considered inactive.  Returning player applications submitted on or after July 1 will be assessed a $10 late fee per player.  Please get your applications in early!</p><br />
                <p>Each season, our club attempts to field both boys and girls teams from U7 through U14 (1st through 8th grade).  In the event that there are not enough players to field a team in a particular age bracket, a collaborative effort is made with the five other NE Portland clubs to pool player data in order to assure your son or daughter the opportunity to play.  At parent/guardian discretion, player information can be shared with other clubs if this situation arises.  Other clubs involved in this important effort include Alameda, Irvington, Rose City, Laurelhurst and Mt Tabor.</p><br />
                <p>In addition to our U7-U14 teams, HWSC hosts Kinder Kick for Kindergarten-aged players, providing a supportive environment for the introduction of soccer.  Register for Kinder Kick the same as you would for any of the other age brackets.  At time of registration, you will be required to choose either the “early” or “late” time slot.  These are typically 4:00 and 5:00, respectively on one weekday afternoon each week during the season.  The day of the week for Kinder Kick sessions is determined in early Fall.  Please do not contact club officers requesting this information – you will be contacted directly.</p><br />
                <p>If your child is interested in Classic soccer, please visit Northeast United Club (NEU) at <a href="http://www.northeastunited.us" target="_blank">www.northeastunited.us</a>.</p>

                <p class="mainheader2">Questions?</p>
                <p>Answers to many possible registration questions may be found by visiting our <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> page.  If your registration-related questions are still not answered, please contact the <a href="mailto:registrar@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">Registrar</a> or other club Officer.</p><br /><br />
