                        <li>Mix and match from among the station drills outlined below, and include a scrimmage at the end of practice.</li>

                        <li>If a planned exercise at a given station isn’t working for your group, then improvise!</li>
                        <li>Remind your players that this practice is about control, not power, and keeping the ball on the ground is a good thing.

                    <p><strong>Station 3: End-Zone Game</strong></p>
                    <p>Team scores by controlling the ball in the opponent’s end zone.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Progressions for End-Zone Game</strong></p>
                    <p>Team can only score by receiving and controlling a pass into the end zone; or by dribbling into the end zone; or after passing the ball back into its own end zone.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>Station 4: Rondos and 1v1</strong></p>
                    <p>Using cones, set up two small goals on one of the end lines. Two players at a time play 1v1 and rotate every few minutes. The rest of the players play a keep-away game. Start with one defender in the middle and add defenders to make
                        it more difficult to keep the ball away from them.</p>

                    <p>Same field setup as Funiño. Each team has a target player who stands in between the goals they are attacking. The aim of this game is to pass forward to the target player and then run to receive a return pass in order to score in the
