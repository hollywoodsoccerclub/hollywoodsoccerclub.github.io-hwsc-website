                    <p>Using cones, set up two small goals on one of the end lines. Two players at a time play 1v1 and rotate every few minutes. The rest of the players play a keep-away game. Start with one defender in the middle and add defenders to make
                        it more difficult to keep the ball away from them.</p>

                    <p>Same field setup as Funiño. Each team has a target player who stands in between the goals they are attacking. The aim of this game is to pass forward to the target player and then run to receive a return pass in order to score in the
