                <p>Welcome to the Hollywood Soccer Club’s website, home to a community-based recreational youth soccer program in Portland, Oregon. Our mission is to provide quality recreational soccer programming for K-8th graders, foster a love of soccer, and create opportunities for adults in the community to coach and support our youth.</p>
                <br />
                <p>While we generally serve players in the Hollywood and Grant Park neighborhoods, children from throughout the Portland metro area are welcome to join our club.  As a non-profit, volunteer-run organization, we focus on a positive soccer experience for all participants by:</p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                	<li>Providing a supportive and safe environment for boys and girls in Kindergarten through 8th grade to learn the game of soccer;</li>
                  <li>Building self-esteem and confidence by promoting responsibility, friendship and teambuilding;</li>
                  <li>Training parent and community volunteers to serve as coaches in support of these goals;</li>
                  <li>Partnering with <a href="https://www.positivecoach.org" target="_blank">Positive Coaching Alliance</a> to support players in becoming better athletes and better people.</li>
                </ul> <br />
                <p>For our youngest players, we host Fall and Spring Kinderkick programs, focused on skill-building and fun.  This hugely popular program gives many participants their first opportunity to play organized soccer.</p>
                <br />
                <p>For players in 1st through 8th grade, we host Fall and Spring recreational programs that include team practices and weekend games against other Portland soccer club teams. We encourage new players to join at any age – you're never too old to start playing soccer!</p>
                <br />
                <p>We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for your player and family.</p>
