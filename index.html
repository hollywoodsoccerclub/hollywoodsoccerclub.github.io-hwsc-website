                    <p class="mainheader">Fall Registration and Update</p>
                    <p class="mainheader2">From Dan Harris, HWSC President</p>
                    <p>Greetings all players, coaches, and families of Hollywood Soccer Club!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>I hope that the summer is bringing some brightened spirits along with the warmer weather. We’re still seeing a lot of uncertainty in the wider community but I am reassured by the cohesiveness of the Hollywood neighborhood to work through
                        it. My own regular pickup and futsal games have yet to restart but I am sure looking forward to them.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>As an update to everyone, the board is working closely with the PYSA and monitoring the state communications and relevant health authorities to assess the viability of the Fall season. Here is the current status:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>We anticipate playing the Fall season.</li>
                        <li>Registration is set to open June 29th.</li>
                        <li>The schedule is set for these dates: September 12, 19, 26; October 3, 10, 17, 24, 31.</li>
                        <li>Rules for practices and games will utilize the best guidelines available and may change the gameplay from the typical rules.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>The board will be meeting briefly on June 27th to discuss Fall registration. We welcome the community to provide comments and join in on the conversation - we would love to hear how families are feeling about playing soccer in the
                        Fall. Email us <a href="mailto:info@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">here</a> to join the call.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>A few other items of note:</p>
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>We must recognize the generosity of the members that donated to the club during Spring Season. We are a community organization and you are a great pillar of support. Thank you.</li>
                        <li>We need help with Social Media/Website. Please consider joining our team if you have these skills. We don’t have an age requirement so consider how “Hollywood Soccer Club Social Media Director” might look on an early career resume!</li>
                        <li>I’d like to announce and welcome to the board our new Secretary, Molly Hylton! She is amazing and we’re happy to have her on board.</li>
                        <li>We always need volunteer coaches. We have free swag for coaches so along with goodwill there is a fashion motivation. Please contact Doug Moore <a href="mailto:coachingdirector@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">here</a> or just register
                            on the HWSC website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>For all those teams eager to informally practice on their own, there is a good resource on the <a href="https://oregonyouthsoccer.org/about-oysa/covid-19-info/" target="_blank">Oregon Youth Soccer Association website</a> for understanding
                        what the best health practices are related to soccer and correlated to the State's phases for opening. These include the guidelines for Phase 1:</p>
                    <br />
                    </ul>
                    <li>No Contact</li>
                    <li>Skills Training</li>
                    <li>9:1 Player: Coach Cohort</li>
                    <li>No equipment sharing</li>
                    <li>10 feet of social distancing</li>
                    <li>Training times set to maximize social distancing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>Please don’t hesitate to email myself or the board <a href="mailto:info@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">here</a> if you have questions. We’ll be communicating regularly while trying not to overwhelm you. We are all a little overloaded at
                        this point.</p>
                    <br />

                    <p>Since we are all cooped up, how about working together to build some skills and show off some moves?</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Our <a href="http://hollywoodsoccerclub.org/practice_plans.html" target="_blank">Practice Plans page</a> offers links to useful videos for learning new individual skills. Practice at home and when Fall comes you'll have an arsenal
                        of new moves.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>But let's not stop there. <a href="mailto:info@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">Send us</a> video links and ideas that you find helpful, or send links to videos of yourself doing new moves or a good training regimen and we'll post them (with
                        your permission, of course).</p>
