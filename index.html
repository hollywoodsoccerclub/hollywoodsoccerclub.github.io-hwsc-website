                    <p class="mainheader2 ">PYSA's 2019 Girls Coach of the Year</p>
                    <p>Hollywood Soccer Club's Jason Hieggelke was recently honored by the Portland Youth Soccer Association as the Girls Coach of the Year for 2019. Jason is a longtime coach &mdash; most recently of the U11G Lightning Bolts &mdash; and

                    <p>At the awards ceremony, he was lauded by his Assistant Coach Myra Lavenue for embodying the Positive Coaching model, and encouraging his team by consistently emphasizing their efforts and progress instead of the score. We appreciate
                        Jason's commitment to excellence and dedication to bringing out the best in his team and fellow board members. Go Jason!</p>

                    <p><strong>Coaches:</strong> We depend on Head Coaches, Assistant Coaches and Team Managers to make a great soccer experience for our players, and we’re lucky to live in a community of soccer playing- and -loving adults who make it happen.
                        Right now, we’re looking for some soccer-playing women to lead teams starting in the Spring – is that you? Email us <a href="mailto:info@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">here</a> for more information, and check out this photo of Coach
                        Laura and Coach Sarah with their U9 team for inspiration.</p>

                    <br />

                    <p><strong>Board of Directors:</strong> We’re always looking for committed and motivated board members. Meetings are typically held on the second Wednesday of the month, and offer a fun and supportive community service experience. Email
                        us <a href="mailto:info@hollywoodsoccerclub.org">here</a> for details about the next meeting. The time commitment for board participation varies by position and season, and generally ranges from five to ten or more hours per month
                        including monthly meetings. Many of our board members are current or former HWSC coaches. We’re currently seeking a Vice President, a Kinderkick Coordinator to begin in the Spring season, and help with communications among other
                        roles.

                    <p>Hollywood Soccer Club's Marc Poris was recently honored by the Portland Youth Soccer Association as the Boys Coach of the Year for 2018. Marc was Head Coach of the HWSC Hornets U13 Boys team during the Fall 2018 season. He's also a
                        longstanding member of the HWSC Board of Directors. Way to go, Marc!</p>

                    <p class="mainheader ">Wait until the season ends to pierce those ears!</p>
                    <p> Are pierced ears in the future for your soccer player? You might want to wait until soccer season ends to have them done. </p>
                    <br />
                    <p> PYSA has a no jewelry policy for games for safety, and players must remove their earrings and other jewelry before the game starts - no earlobe taping, flat plastic earrings or exceptions are allowed! Even under ideal conditions, pierced
                        ears can take a minimum of 6 weeks to heal completely, and often need more time. Removing earrings from newly pierced ears for the duration of a game can lead to pain when they’re replaced, or even worse, closed holes.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p> HWSC wants to encourage harmonious coexistence between ear piercing and soccer playing. To avoid the potential heartbreak, discomfort and expense of dealing with pierced ear complications, we recommend waiting until soccer season ends
                        to get them pierced. And a group ear piercing expedition could be just the thing for soccer friends to wrap up a season. </p>
