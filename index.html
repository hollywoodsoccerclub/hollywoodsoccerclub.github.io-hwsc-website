                <p class="mainheader2">About Hollywood Soccer Club</p>
                <p>Welcome to the Hollywood Soccer Club’s website, home to a community-based recreational youth soccer program in Portland, Oregon.  While we generally serve players in the Hollywood / Grant Park district, children from throughout Portland are welcome to be a part of our club.  As a non-profit, volunteer-run organization our mission focuses on a positive soccer experience for all participants by:</p>
                <br />
                <ul>
                	<li>Providing a supportive and safe environment for boys and girls in which to learn the game of soccer</li>
                    <li>Teaching players of all ages and abilities the rules and skills of the game</li>
                    <li>Building self-esteem and confidence by promoting responsibility, friendship and teambuilding</li>
                    <li>Training parent and community volunteers to serve as coaches in support of these goals</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>Hollywood Soccer Club offers programs for players from Kindergarten through 8th grade. For our youngest players, we host a Fall ‘Kinder Kick’ program, focused on skill-building and fun.  This hugely popular program gives many participants their first opportunity to play organized soccer.</p>
                <br />
                <p>For boys and girls from 1st through 8th grade we host Fall and Spring recreational programs that include team practices and weekend games against other Portland soccer club teams.   We encourage new players to join at any age – you are never too old to begin soccer!</p>
                <br />
                <p>For more advanced players, our club is affiliated with Northeast United (NEU), a competitive youth club.  This program offers advanced skill building through its 4th grade Develop Academy and hosts competitive teams for 5th through 8th grade players.  Hollywood Soccer Club is also proud to support partnerships with various organizations to bring summer camps to our local neighborhood.  Please visit the <a href="soccer_programs.html">Programs & Camps</a> page for details.</p>  
                <br />
              <p>Whatever your child’s needs are from recreational through competitive soccer, Hollywood Soccer Club is a great place to call "home".</p>
