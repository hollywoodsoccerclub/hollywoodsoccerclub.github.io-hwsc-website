                    <p class="mainheader">Spring 2020 Season Cancelled</p>
                    <p class="mainheader2">A Message from the HWSC Board of Directors</p>
                    <p>Based on the current guidelines, regulations, and recommendations from state and local authorities and for the safety of the league's members, Portland Youth Soccer Association (PYSA) has decided to cancel the Spring 2020 season. We
                        know that this is a disappointing update, but player, coach, referee, and spectator safety is paramount both to PYSA and Hollywood Soccer Club (HWSC).</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The board of directors for HWSC is reviewing refund options for all Spring 2020 participants, who will receive an additional email update soon with more information regarding refunds. HWSC is a non-profit, all-volunteer organization,
                        and if you wish to donate your player's registration fee, in total or in part, we will use it to offset registration costs incurred this Spring season. Simply respond affirmatively to the email to opt in.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>We thank you for your patience, understanding, and support during this difficult time, and we look forward to seeing you in the upcoming Fall 2020 season.</p>
                    <br />
